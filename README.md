# Building Neural Network in python

This project implements a simple single-layer neural network using Python and NumPy. 
The network supports both user-defined input and a demo mode. The activation functions used are ReLU and Sigmoid, with appropriate derivatives for backpropagation.

## Features for the single layer neural network

- Supports **user input** for a 4x3 input matrix and corresponding expected outputs.
- Implements **ReLU activation** for user-defined input.
- Implements **Sigmoid activation** for demo mode.
- Includes **backpropagation** for training using gradient descent.
- Calculates **error margins** for output accuracy.

**This is the demo result**
